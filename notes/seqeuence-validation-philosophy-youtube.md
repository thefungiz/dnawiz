Sequence Validation

For the ITS 5% is huge. (speaker) - temp code and move on. For our case, it would make sense to describe it.

Hygrophorous have great variation.

Look at iNat for sequence notes.

Collab with other scientists on iNat.

Look at the assention number. Find out what published work references it. Check Mycobank or index fungorum. 

>99% is concenses in name.

Look at the quality of the paper being published with.

How to make a temp code?

Many problem groups where ITS isn't a good indicator.

Don't overanalyze specimens. If it's getting complicated, move on to others.
